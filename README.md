# HealthCareSystem
The system consists of various diagnostic centers, with their own tests which the customers can opt for. The system should be accessible to two types of users, namely admin and customer. Admin has control over adding, removing and updating diagnostic centers and the tests under them. 

Customer makes an appointment after selecting a proper date-time as well as the test and diagnostic center. The appointment will be confirmed only after the admin approves it.
